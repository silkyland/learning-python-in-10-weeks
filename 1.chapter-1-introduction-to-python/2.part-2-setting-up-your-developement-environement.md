# Chapter 1: Introduction to Python

## Part 2: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Now that you're excited about Python, let's set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Choose an IDE**: As mentioned earlier, I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** or **PyCharm**. Both are excellent choices for Python development.

2. **Install Python**:

   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version.
   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH." This ensures that you can run Python from the command line.

3. **Verify Installation**:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version (e.g., Python 3.9.6).

4. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):

   - Virtual environments allow you to isolate Python packages for different projects.
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
     Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`

5. **Hello, World!**:
   - Create a new Python file (e.g., `hello.py`) in your chosen IDE.
   - Write the following code:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Run the script. You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the console.

### Next Steps:

- Familiarize yourself with Python's basic syntax, data types, and control structures.
- Explore Python's official documentation and tutorials.
- Practice writing small programs to reinforce your learning.
